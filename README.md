# 🔗 MultiChain Platform Token (MPT)

MultiChain Platform Token (MPT) is a universal bridge token framework that interoperates seamlessly with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and Stellar.  
It provides privacy-preserving transfers, smart-contract logic, atomic swaps, and anchored issuance in a single unified token.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔄 Cross-Chain Transfers  
  • Atomic swaps on Bitcoin (regtest or mainnet)  
  • ERC-20 token on Ethereum  
  • Privacy channel via Monero’s ring signatures  
  • Anchor issuance on Stellar  

- 🤝 Pegging & Atomic Swaps  
  • Trustless one-to-one pegs between MPT and BTC/ETH/XMR/XLM collateral  
  • On-chain proofs and swap agents for secure transfer  

- 🛡️ Privacy Layer  
  • Optional privacy using Monero’s stealth addresses  
  • Confidential mode for BTC and ETH operations  

- 📜 Smart Contracts  
  • ERC-20 MPT contract with mint, burn, and governance functions  
  • Upgradeable via standard proxy patterns  

- 🌐 Stellar Anchor Integration  
  • Deposit/withdraw USD, BTC, or ETH through Stellar anchors  
  • Issuance and redemption managed on-ledger
